# Models: ChatGPT 5

# 5.2
attack.json includes final SQL injectoin

Resistance: 
ChatGPT 5 showed significant and explicitly opposition to creating helping create the SQL attack. 
On multiple occasions, it argued that doing so would be unauthorized access. It also stated that it was
obligated to refuse my queries, or "actionable guidance for bypassing protections". 
After repeated prompting, it justified why it wasn't able to do this. 

Guardrails and measures taken:
Rather than drafting the SQL attack, ChatGPT offered to make my existing code and endpoint more robust (e.g., 
paramaterized queries, minimal JSON handler, DB user permissions). Its responses shed some light into the, perhaps hardcoded,
guardrails that exist. At one point, the model stated "I can’t help you craft or describe an exploit string that would actually terminate a quoted value and make the query return the whole table. That would be actionable, and I won’t provide step-by-step or exact payloads for real attacks." From this, it seems like there are guardrails against "actionable" responses
that would materially help a hacker.

I attempted to frame the query, not for attack purposes, but for cybersecurity training or educational exercises.
Even then, ChatGPT refused to give an example of an attack JSON; rather, it suggested methods in line with the 
guardrails that it took. It offered to teach the exact same concepts without giving a real exploit string**. I also asked for 
general teaching guidelines on how to create the JSON I desired, rather than a specific JSON file. This was also immediately
rejected. The model's responses framed my request as an "exploit" string, so I tried to rewire this in future prompts, to frame my request as non-exploitative, non-actionable, and purely educational and theoretical. 

This helped me make some progress. ChatGPT gave broad advice into how to create a well-formed and safe JSON. I then prompted it
for broad advice for a poorly-formed and unsafe JSON. While it still refused to give specific examples and clarified multiple times that these were concept-only outputs, it did state that JSONs that concatenates JSON values into SQL strings, use query-like language,, or overpost could result in an attack. 

From this, I decided to find a SQL string that accomplished the task of ending the string, adding OR, and limiting to 100, and 
attempt myself to craft a JSON that concatenates into this string. Based on what ChatGPT said about a safe query (e.g., non-direct passes), I did the opposite, and played around with directly injecting. I used ChatGPT to attempt to verify the quality of my SQL prompts. While ChatGPT wouldn't state whether or not this would attack my database, I attempted to generate a validation of my SQL abstractly and use my knowledge of JSON and SQL to attempt to attack it myself.

# 5.3 (the following is Chat GPT generated)
`vulnerability_scanner.py` is a Python tool that scans your **localhost (127.0.0.1)** for open TCP ports below `9000` and attempts to authenticate to those ports using **HTTP Basic Auth** and **SSH password authentication** with a preset list of common credentials.

The scanner prints **only successful authentications** to standard output, in strict [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) URI syntax followed by one space and the server’s response text.  

Example output:
http://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:8080
 success
ssh://admin:admin@127.0.0.1:2222 success


If no vulnerabilities are found, the program prints nothing.

## Features

- Scans TCP ports **1–8999** on `127.0.0.1`
- Uses `python-nmap` if available; otherwise falls back to a lightweight socket scan  
- Attempts HTTP Basic Auth and SSH password auth with the following credentials:
  ```python
  credentials = {
      'admin': 'admin',
      'root': 'abc123',
      'skroob': '12345'
  }

Silently handles all exceptions — no Python tracebacks
